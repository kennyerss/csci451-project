## Planned Deliverables

We plan to create a model that can predict a person's race based on the image of their chest X-ray. We will also include a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the efficacy of this model.

If everything works out as planned, we will have a great predictive model and a beautiful analysis of its efficacy in a Jupyter notebook. We will also have a chance to analyze the factors that contribute to the model's accuracy; we can look at the most interesting features and the potential biases that may be present in the data. We can start to think about how this model can be used (ethically) in a clinical setting (does this help with diagnosis at all? etc.).

If things don't 100% work out, we at least tried and I think that's great. Our deliverables will be a Python package and a Jupyter notebook explaining exactly why we fail: there may not be enough data; the rib cages of people from different ethnic backgrounds may not look very different (we may need to look for research papers on this); etc. We can also badmouth the model in this Jupyter notebook to justify that failing may actually be a good thing (the model can become evil if it falls into the wrong hands, etc.).

## Resources Required

We need chest X-ray datasets that include the race of the patient. Right now we're considering using data from [here](https://stanfordaimi.azurewebsites.net/datasets/192ada7c-4d43-466e-b8bb-b81992bb80cf). This has a .csv file with race labels for the patients in study 1. We're still looking for more data because knowledge is power.
