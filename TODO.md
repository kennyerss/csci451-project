TODO Tasks

Algorithm
* Data loader is implemented (I think)
* Everyone should read the papers
* Download data and put it in place where all can access - Jay-U downloaded data and shared drive, but only downloaded some of dataset, and no validation data
* Look over paper or make decision on how to handle the class labels i.e. "White", "White, non-Hispanic", "White Hispanic" (I think a good place to start would be binary classification - make labels according to whether or not subject is white)
* Review weeks 9 and 10, implement some algorithm - Logistic Regression or basic Convolution Neural Network
* Implement ResNet https://blog.paperspace.com/writing-resnet-from-scratch-in-pytorch/ or https://www.run.ai/guides/deep-learning-for-computer-vision/pytorch-resnet OR find other algorithm we can implement

Ethics
* Find papers
