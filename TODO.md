TODO Tasks

Algorithm
* Data loader is implemented (I think)
* Everyone should read the papers https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(22)00063-2/fulltext
* * In particular - what kind of models do they use? Seems Resnet or EfficientNetB4
* * What kind of logistic loss (I think AUC)
* Download data and put it in place where all can access - Jay-U downloaded data and shared drive, but only downloaded some of dataset, and no validation data
* Reconfigure the chexpert DEMO csv and the train.csv so each patient id can be linked to their race - we may need to get rid of some data, namely the patients whose race is "Other", etc.
* Look over paper or make decision on how to handle the class labels i.e. "White", "White, non-Hispanic", "White Hispanic" (I think a good place to start would be binary classification - make labels according to whether or not subject is white)
* Review class notes from week 9 and 10, implement some algorithm from these - either Logistic Regression or basic Convolution Neural Network
* Implement ResNet https://blog.paperspace.com/writing-resnet-from-scratch-in-pytorch/ or https://www.run.ai/guides/deep-learning-for-computer-vision/pytorch-resnet OR find other algorithm we can implement

Ethics
* Find papers
